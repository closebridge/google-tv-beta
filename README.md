* **This is going to be a really cool long-term project!**

*How cool is that?*

## Page feature
As this project is a silly side project to recreate a funny hoax, of course I want to make this thing a real "YouTube Client". I want to make at least it look good for everyone!

### Features
1. Basic feature (Functional search, search result, and playback functions)
2. Single page 
3. Working channel picker (with single page feature) (I didn't expect to finish this one LOL)
4. Fill up the 2nd channel picker 
5. Working changelog
   
### Working in Progress  
1. Actual navbar instead of decoration 💨
2. "Login" prompt (for video history). 💤
3. Advance Search (search point to different thing if checked) (Not yet materialized) 🤔
4. API Token window (Not yet materialized) 🤔
5. Actual channel sorting system 💤
6. Imaginary "ad" player (Not yet materialized) 🤔
 

**Subject to changes**
