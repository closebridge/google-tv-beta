* An adorable recreation of Google TV Beta, an extremely well-made hoax that dates back to 2008.
* **This is going to be a really cool long-term project!**

*How cool is that?*

## Page feature
As this project is a silly side project to recreate a funny hoax, of course I want to make this thing a real "YouTube Client". I want to make at least it look good for everyone!

### Features
1. Basic feature (Functional search, search result, and playback functions)
2. Working channel picker (with single page feature) (I didn't expect to finish this one LOL)
3. Working changelog
4. Fake login prompt
